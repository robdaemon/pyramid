# pyramid

A Pyramid Solitaire game written in 68k assembly

## Building

Install [EASy68k](http://www.easy68k.com/) - the game runs entirely in this simulator today. It will eventually be ported to HiSoft DevPac.

The C version of this uses the [vbcc](http://sun.hasenbraten.de/vbcc/) compiler to target Atari TOS.

The ultimate goal is a game that works on both Atari ST and Commodore Amiga computers.
